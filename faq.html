                        <p>Sourdough is one of the most ancient forms of bread, dating back as far as 4000 BC! It is is a naturally leavened bread, meaning that it doesn't use commercial yeast to rise. Instead, it uses naturally occurring bacteria and yeast to ferment before baking. The lactic acid that is produced during the fermentation process is what gives sourdough its iconic sour taste!

                        What are the benefits of sourdough bread compared to regular bread?

                        <p>Research has shown that sourdough bread pose a number of health benefits. <br><br>
                        
                        For instance, sourdough bread is particularly rich in nutrients that the body can easily absorb, as the bacteria in the bread destroys certain acids that are commonly found in other types of bread, resulting in the increase in availability of nutrients such as folate, potassium, and magnesium. <br><br>
                        
                        Lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are also responsible for increasing antioxidants in bread, providing the body protection from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough may also help stabilize blood sugar levels more than white bread, meaning that your insulin levels will not spike as high after eating sourdough as they would after eating white bread. <br><br>
                        
                        According to some studies, sourdough may be easier to digest than white bread due to it acting as a probiotic, feeding the "good" bacteria in your intestines. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough is also lower in gluten than other forms of bread, making it easier on the stomachs of those who are gluten intolerant.

                        <p>Just like how a packet of commercial yeast makes dinner rolls rise, bacteria and yeast that exist naturally in the air around us helps sourdough rise by settling and multiplying in the dough. By adding water to flour and letting the dough ferment, the bacteria and yeast is activated and it converts the sugars in the flour into ethanol, carbon dioxide, and acids. These carbon dioxide bubbles expand the dough, and when baked at a high temperature, they expand even more, making the bread rise!

                        <p>Absolutely! Sourdough may seem complex at first, and the vast abundance of information on the internet may seem overwhelming, but once you understand the basic science behind the process and start simple, you'll notice that 90% of sourdough baking is patience! <br><br>
                        
                        Start by making a sourdough starter (or purchasing a well-established starter from my online store), which will become the foundation for all your baking. It's essentially a mixture of flour and water that naturally ferments to capture wild yeast. Once your starter is active and bubbly, you're ready to bake your first loaf! <br><br>

                        You can follow my beginner-friendly recipe to guide you step by step. Remember, mistakes are part of the process, and every loaf teaches you something new. With a bit of practice, you'll be crafting beautiful sourdough loaves that you'll be proud of.

                        <p>Sourdough starter is a living culture of flour and water that contains wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. It is added to sourdough dough to make the bread rise and give it its signature flavour and holes. You can create your own sourdough starter or buy a dried starter from my online shop! Either way, you will need to feed it every day by adding flour and water to the mixture. The bacteria in your environment and flour will feed on the mixture, creating bubbles and making it rise.

                        <p>You can make your own sourdough starter by mixing a little bit of flour and water in a jar every day. Eventually, you will notice the mixture becoming bubbly and smelling sour. This means your sourdough starter is active!<br><br>

                        You can also buy a packet of dried sourdough starter from my online shop. It originates from a well-established 150-year-old San Francisco sourdough starter, so this option may be more straightforward for beginners. Similar to making your sourdough starter from scratch, this method will also require feeding the starter flour and water every day. However, since it directly involves a mature starter culture, it will likely create a stronger result and will take less time to activate.

                        <p>To keep your starter healthy, discard roughly half of your starter (to manage growth) and then feed the remaining starter with 1/3 cup unbleached flour and up to 1/3 cup filtered water every day at around the same time. You want the resulting mixture to be thick and mousse-like. You will notice the starter grow in size and fill with lots of air bubbles after feeding. After it has reached its peak, it will begin to fall back down. I recommend marking the initial sourdough size with an elastic band after feeding so that you can track your starter's growth.<br><br>
                        In terms of storage, keep your starter in a glass jar or plastic container, topped with a lid or paper towel secured with an elastic band. You can keep your starter on your kitchen counter.

                        <p>4-8 hours after you feed your starter, it should become very bubbly and peak in size, becoming active. Active starter is what we use to bake sourdough as it is at peak activity level and can provide bread with rising power. It is different from sourdough discard as discard is typically less bubbly and thinner than active starter. Discard may also be called inactive starter, as it is usually not active enough to make bread rise. Basically, once your starter has peaked and collapsed, it is considered discard.

                        <p>The biggest factor that can affect your starter's activity and growth time is temperature. The ideal temperature for sourdough starter is 24-28°C, but don't worry if you're outside of this temperature range! A cooler temperature simply means that your starter will take more time to ferment and become active, while a warmer temperature means that your starter will take less time to ferment and become active. To keep your starter warm, consider placing it in the oven with the light on.<br><br>
                        Flour type is another factor that can impact your starter. I recommend using unbleached bread flour or all-purpose flour, however whole grains are a great option if you would like to increase the activity of your starter.<br><br>
                        If you would like to further increase the activity of your starter, consider feeding it twice a day (once in the morning, once at night).

Many people also recommend using a banneton, which is a special bread basket for proofing the dough, however I don't find it mandatory as you can alternatively use a bowl or colander with a tea towel placed inside.

                        <p>Since the ideal flour protein content for sourdough baking is 12.5%-14% (this protein percentage provides the best bread structure), many people recommend using bread flour as it typically has a high protein content. However, I personally use all-purpose flour as the specific brand I use has a protein percentage of 13%. I find that bread flour and all-purpose flour are both great choices for sourdough baking as long as the protein percentage falls between the ideal range, so I recommend checking the protein percentage of the flour you have on hand. <br><br>

                        If you would like your loaf to have a more complex and sour flavour, I would recommend incorporating some whole wheat flour or rye flour into your blend. Although it may make your bread less volumous, it will provide your loaf with a rich, earthy flavour. Try experimenting with different flours to see what you like the best!

                        <p><b>Flour:</b> Provides the wild yeast with food to feed on. When combined with water, the protein in the flour produces elastic gluten strands that trap the carbon dioxide that is produced as a product of the fermentation process, which helps the loaf rise.<br><br>

                        <b>Water:</b> Dissolves the starter so that it is evenly distributed and necessary for fermentation and gluten development when mixed with flour.<br><br>

                        <b>Sourdough Starter:</b> Provides the wild yeast that feeds on the flour during the fermentation process, allowing the bread to rise through the production of carbon dioxide bubbles. The yeast is also responsible for the signature sour flavour of sourdough, as acid is another byproduct of fermentation.<br><br>

                        <b>Salt: </b> Strengthens the gluten in the dough, which helps with trapping carbon dioxide air bubbles. It also helps control the fermentation process to ensure that the yeast doesn't run out of food to feed on.

                        What is the sourdough baking process?

                        <p>Understanding the stages of sourdough baking is crucial for making adjustments to improve your bread.<br><br>
                        <b>1. Autolyse/Fermentolyse:</b> Autolyse is the process where flour and water are mixed and left to rest, with the starter and salt added after this short rest is complete. Fermentolyse is where the flour, water, starter, and salt are mixed together and left to rest. This short rest (about an hour) of both processes gives the flour time to fully hydrate and begin gluten development, which helps make the dough more elastic and easier to handle later on. My recipe uses the fermentolyse option (for no real reason, so feel free to use the autolyse method instead if you prefer!). <br><br>

                        <b>2. Stretch and Fold:</b> This step involves pulling up sections of dough, stretching it upwards as much as possible, and folding it down over itself. The purpose of this step is to strengthen the dough and build gluten so that the final loaf has a proper structure and rise. My recipe involves two sets of stretch and folds: one at the end of the fermentolyse, and the second 30 minutes later. <br><br>

                        <b>3. Bulk Fermentation: </b> Also known as the first rise, this is where the dough is left to rest for 8-12 hours. It technically begins as soon as the starter is mixed with the flour and water, so the stretch and fold step occurs simultaneously. The purpose of this step is to give the wild yeast time to feed and produce carbon dioxide air bubbles, which is why you'll see your dough increase significantly in size. The length of this step depends on a variety of factors, including kitchen temperature, hydration levels, and starter strength. <br><br>

                        <b>4. Shaping: </b> This step is where we gently shape the dough into a tight ball or oval (depending on which final loaf shape we would like). By creating tension on the surface of the dough, the loaf will rise upwards (oven spring) instead of flattening out when baking. <br><br>

                        <b>5. Second Rise/Proof: </b> After shaping, we let the dough rise a second time, for a much shorter period (up to 1-2 hours). By providing the yeast a second opportunity to ferment, we can create more air bubbles in our dough as well as a more complex final flavour. <br><br>

                        <b>6. Scoring: </b> This is where we create the beautifully iconic designs on the surface of our dough! Not only are scores fun and beautiful, but they help our loaf expand in a controlled manner so that it doesn't burst in random places during the bake. <br><br>

                        <b>7. Bake: </b> The final step in the sourdough baking process is baking the bread in the oven. The most common way to bake a sourdough loaf is in a pre-heated dutch oven. By utilizing the heat and moisture that is trapped inside the dutch oven, we can help the loaf expand to its full potential. It is important to let the bread cool completely before cutting so that the moisture inside the bread can settle in the crumb. Cutting the bread too early can cause a gummy texture.

                        <p>There isn't one clear answer to know when bulk fermentation is done as each dough and kitchen environment is different, but you'll get better at knowing through experience. The signs that I look for include: a 75%-100% increase in dough size, visible bubbles on the sides of the bowl, "jiggly" movement upon shaking the bowl, and an airy texture upon poking the dough. A domed surface is another sign that many bakers look for. When you turn the dough onto a floured surface, the dough should be loose, but be shapable and have structure. If you find that the dough is too sticky and impossible to shape, chances are it's overfermented (bake it anyway, it'll still taste delicious!). In this case, I would recommend skipping the second rise completely.

                        <p>Typically, I look for a "relaxed" dough that looks puffy. The dough should not increase in size as much as the bulk fermentation stage. Many bakers employ the poke test: when poking the dough gently with a floured finger, a perfectly proofed dough will have the indentation fill back slowly. An underproofed dough will have the indentation fill in immediately, while an overproofed dough will have an indentation that doesn't fill back at all. I don't typically use the poke test as I find the results difficult to analyze.

                        <p>Hydration percentage is calculated by dividing the weight of the water in the dough by the weight of the flour, and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Standard hydration percentage can range anywhere from 60%-75%, and a lower hydration percentage is typically recommended for beginners as the dough is easier to handle. Higher protein percentage flours require a higher hydration percentage to fully hydrate the dough. A higher hydration percentage results in a more open crumb (more large air bubbles) and requires less time to ferment, while a lower hydration percentage results in a more closed crumb (less large air bubbles) and requires more time to ferment. My go-to hydration level is between 70%-75%.

                        <p>To help your bread rise better in the oven, re-evaluate your stretch and folds as well as your shaping technique. Remember, the purpose of stretch and folds are to strengthen the dough and create gluten. Are you pulling the dough as far as it can go without tearing? Make sure you're grabbing sufficient portions of the dough! When shaping, we want to create surface tension on the dough. Be gentle with your work as not to crush the air bubbles inside, but don't be afraid to handle the dough with confident movements. You can also increase the fermentation time of your dough to create more air bubbles, which could help your loaf rise better.

A warmer kitchen and higher hydration levels typically mean a shorter fermentation time, while a cooler kitchen and lower hydration levels mean a longer fermentation time. My kitchen is roughly 22°C and I use a hydration level of 70%-75%. My bulk fermentation stage is around 12 hours, while my second rise is around 1-1.5 hours.

You can either cover the top of the jar with a lid or use a paper towel secured with an elastic band. Using reactive metals such as aluminum and copper is typically not recommended when dealing with sourdough starters as it may impede its fermentation ability (stainless steel is fine). If you bake often, keep your starter on your kitchen counter and feed it daily. If you don't bake often and don't plan on feeding your starter every day, keep your starter in an air-tight glass jar in the back of your fridge. This way, your starter can survive for months (or even years) without being fed.

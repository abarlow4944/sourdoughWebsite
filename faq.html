                        <p>Sourdough is one of the most ancient forms of bread, dating back as far as 4000 BC! It is is a naturally leavened bread, meaning that it doesn't use commercial yeast to rise. Instead, it uses naturally occurring bacteria and yeast to ferment before baking. The lactic acid that is produced during the fermentation process is what gives sourdough its iconic sour taste!

                        What are the benefits of sourdough bread compared to regular bread?

                        <p>Research has shown that sourdough bread pose a number of health benefits. <br><br>
                        
                        For instance, sourdough bread is particularly rich in nutrients that the body can easily absorb, as the bacteria in the bread destroys certain acids that are commonly found in other types of bread, resulting in the increase in availability of nutrients such as folate, potassium, and magnesium. <br><br>
                        
                        Lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are also responsible for increasing antioxidants in bread, providing the body protection from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough may also help stabilize blood sugar levels more than white bread, meaning that your insulin levels will not spike as high after eating sourdough as they would after eating white bread. <br><br>
                        
                        According to some studies, sourdough may be easier to digest than white bread due to it acting as a probiotic, feeding the "good" bacteria in your intestines. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough is also lower in gluten than other forms of bread, making it easier on the stomachs of those who are gluten intolerant.

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Just like how a packet of commercial yeast makes dinner rolls rise, bacteria and yeast that exist naturally in the air around us helps sourdough rise by settling and multiplying in the dough. By adding water to flour and letting the dough ferment, the bacteria and yeast is activated and it converts the sugars in the flour into ethanol, carbon dioxide, and acids. These carbon dioxide bubbles expand the dough, and when baked at a high temperature, they expand even more, making the bread rise!

                        <p>Absolutely! Sourdough may seem complex at first, and the vast abundance of information on the internet may seem overwhelming, but once you understand the basic science behind the process and start simple, you'll notice that 90% of sourdough baking is patience! <br><br>
                        
                        Start by making a sourdough starter (or purchasing a well-established starter from my online store), which will become the foundation for all your baking. It's essentially a mixture of flour and water that naturally ferments to capture wild yeast. Once your starter is active and bubbly, you're ready to bake your first loaf! <br><br>

                        You can follow my beginner-friendly recipe to guide you step by step. Remember, mistakes are part of the process, and every loaf teaches you something new. With a bit of practice, you'll be crafting beautiful sourdough loaves that you'll be proud of.

                        <p>Sourdough starter is a living culture of flour and water that contains wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. It is added to sourdough dough to make the bread rise and give it its signature flavour and holes. You can create your own sourdough starter or buy a dried starter from my online shop! Either way, you will need to feed it every day by adding flour and water to the mixture. The bacteria in your environment and flour will feed on the mixture, creating bubbles and making it rise.

                        <p>You can make your own sourdough starter by mixing a little bit of flour and water in a jar every day. Eventually, you will notice the mixture becoming bubbly and smelling sour. This means your sourdough starter is active!<br><br>

                        You can also buy a packet of dried sourdough starter from my online shop. It originates from a well-established 150-year-old San Francisco sourdough starter, so this option may be more straightforward for beginners. Similar to making your sourdough starter from scratch, this method will also require feeding the starter flour and water every day. However, since it directly involves a mature starter culture, it will likely result in a stronger result and will take less time to activate.

                        <p>To keep your starter healthy, discard roughly half of your starter (to manage growth) and then feed the remaining starter with 1/3 cup unbleached flour and up to 1/3 cup filtered water every day at around the same time. You want the resulting mixture to be thick and mousse-like. You will notice the starter grow in size and fill with lots of air bubbles after feeding. After it has reached its peak, it will begin to fall back down. I recommend marking the initial sourdough size with an elastic band after feeding so that you can track your starter's growth.<br><br>
                        In terms of storage, keep your starter in a glass jar or plastic container, topped with a lid or paper towel secured with an elastic band. You can keep your starter on your kitchen counter.

                        <p>I recommend using unbleached bread flour or all-purpose flour for sourdough feedings as bleached flour can make your starter less active. You can also use whole grain flours such as whole wheat or rye. Whole grain flours typically have higher levels of natural yeasts and bacteria, which can speed up the fermentation process.

                        <p>Sourdough discard is the portion of the starter you remove before feeding. This is done to manage the growth of the starter and refresh its acidity levels.

                        <p>4-8 hours after you feed your starter, it should become very bubbly and peak in size, becoming active. Active starter is what we use to bake sourdough as it is at peak activity level and can provide bread with rising power. It is different from sourdough discard as discard is typically less bubbly and thinner than active starter. Discard may also be called inactive starter, as it is usually not active enough to make bread rise. Basically, once your starter has peaked and collapsed, it is considered discard.

                        <p>A sourdough starter ratio refers to the ratio of of flour and water that is used relative to the amount of starter that you have for feedings. It is written as X:Y:Z, where X is starter, Y is flour, and Z is water. The most common starter ratio is 1:1:1, also known as 100% hydration starter. I don't typically follow a specific ratio, as I rely on the consistency of my starter to make adjustments. You should always aim for a thick, mousse-like consistency for your starter!

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>The biggest factor that can affect your starter's activity and growth time is temperature. The ideal temperature for sourdough starter is 24-28°C, but don't worry if you're outside of this temperature range! A cooler temperature simply means that your starter will take more time to ferment and become active, while a warmer temperature means that your starter will take less time to ferment and become active. To keep your starter warm, consider placing it in the oven with the light on.<br><br>
                        Flour type is another factor that can impact your starter. I recommend using unbleached bread flour or all-purpose flour, however whole grains are a great option if you would like to increase the activity of your starter.<br><br>
                        If you would like to further increase the activity of your starter, consider feeding it twice a day (once in the morning, once at night).

                        <p>Sourdough is one of the most ancient forms of bread, dating back as far as 4000 BC! It is is a naturally leavened bread, meaning that it doesn't use commercial yeast to rise. Instead, it uses naturally occurring bacteria and yeast to ferment before baking. The lactic acid that is produced during the fermentation process is what gives sourdough its iconic sour taste!

                        What are the benefits of sourdough bread compared to regular bread?

                    <div class="panel">
                        <p>Research has shown that sourdough bread pose a number of health benefits. <br><br>
                        
                        For instance, sourdough bread is particularly rich in nutrients that the body can easily absorb, as the bacteria in the bread destroys certain acids that are commonly found in other types of bread, resulting in the increase in availability of nutrients such as folate, potassium, and magnesium. <br><br>
                        
                        Lactic acid bacteria in sourdough are also responsible for increasing antioxidants in bread, providing the body protection from diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough may also help stabilize blood sugar levels more than white bread, meaning that your insulin levels will not spike as high after eating sourdough as they would after eating white bread. <br><br>
                        
                        According to some studies, sourdough may be easier to digest than white bread due to it acting as a probiotic, feeding the "good" bacteria in your intestines. <br><br>
                        
                        Sourdough is also lower in gluten than other forms of bread, making it easier on the stomachs of those who are gluten intolerant.

                        <p>Just like how a packet of commercial yeast makes dinner rolls rise, bacteria and yeast that exist naturally in the air around us helps sourdough rise by settling and multiplying in the dough. By adding water to flour and letting the dough ferment, the bacteria and yeast is activated and it converts the sugars in the flour into ethanol, carbon dioxide, and acids. These carbon dioxide bubbles expand the dough, and when baked at a high temperature, they expand even more, making the bread rise!

                        <p>Absolutely! Sourdough may seem complex at first, and the vast abundance of information on the internet may seem overwhelming, but once you understand the basic science behind the process and start simple, you'll notice that 90% of sourdough baking is patience! <br><br>
                        
                        Start by making a sourdough starter (or purchasing a well-established starter from my online store), which will become the foundation for all your baking. It's essentially a mixture of flour and water that naturally ferments to capture wild yeast. Once your starter is active and bubbly, you're ready to bake your first loaf! <br><br>

                        You can follow my beginner-friendly recipe to guide you step by step. Remember, mistakes are part of the process, and every loaf teaches you something new. With a bit of practice, you'll be crafting beautiful sourdough that you'll be proud of.

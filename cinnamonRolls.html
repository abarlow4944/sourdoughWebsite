                <h2>Sourdough Discard Cinnamon Rolls</h2>

                    <li><b>Cook time:</b> 30 minutes</li>
                    <li><b>Yield:</b> 12-14 rolls</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <b>Dough:</b>
                    <li>160g milk</li>
                    <li>28g melted butter</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>2 large eggs</li>
                    <li>100g sourdough starter (active or discard)</li>
                    <li>24g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>300g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>5g salt</li>
                    <br>
                    <b>Filling:</b>
                    <li>28g unsalted butter</li>
                    <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp ground cinnamon</li>
                    <li>28g unsalted butter</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>1. Make Milk Mixture</b><br>
                    Combine the melted butter and milk in a small bowl.
                </p>

                <p><b>2. Make the Dough</b><br>
                    Add the egg, sourdough starter, and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Mix to combine (about 1 minute). Slowly pour in the milk mixture. Add the flour and salt. Continue mixing until a rough, sticky dough forms (about 1 minute). Cover with a damp towel and let rest for 30 minutes.
                </p>

                <p><b>3. Knead the Dough</b><br>
                    Switch to the dough hook and knead on medium-low for 6-8 minutes, or until the dough passes the window pane test (when you take a small portion of the dough and stretch it thinly with your fingers, you can see through the light pass through the dough without it tearing). 
                </p>

                <p><b>4. Bulk Rise</b><br>
                    Transfer the dough to a medium-sized glass bowl coated in butter, cover in plastic wrap and let rise overnight for 8-12 hours, or until it doubles in size. About 30 minutes into the bulk rise, do a set of stretch and folds: Pick up the dough on one side, stretch it upwards and fold it over onto itself. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat until you have turned the bowl a full circle.
                </p>

                <p><b>5. Prepare for Rolling</b><br>
                    Transfer the dough onto a floured surface and gently pat it into a rectangle. Let the dough rest for 10 minutes (for easier rolling).
                </p> 

                <p><b>6. Roll Into a Rectangle</b><br>
                    Dust the dough and a rolling pin with flour and roll the dough into a 16 x 12 rectangle.
                </p>

                <p><b>7. Sprinkle the Filling</b><br>
                    Brush the surface of the dough with melted butter. Combine sugar, cinnamon, and flour in a bowl and sprinkle the mixture onto the dough, leaving a small border around the edges. Smooth it out with your hands.
                </p>

                <p><b>8. Roll Into a Log</b><br>
                    Roll the dough into a tight log, pressing down gently as you go. You should end up seam-side down. Slice the log into as many sections as you would like using dental floss. Do this by sliding the floss underneath the log, holding one end of the floss with each hand. Lift the floss and cross the two ends over each other to slice through the dough.
                </p>

                <p><b>9. Second Rise</b><br>
                    Place the rolls into a skillet lined with parchment paper and let rest for 1-2 hours, until the dough puffs up.
                </p>

                <p><b>10. Bake</b><br>
                    Bake the rolls at 425°C for 35-40 minutes (check at 30 minutes). The tops should turn light golden brown.
                </p>

                <p><b>11. Let Cool</b><br>
                    Remove the rolls from the oven and let cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Transfer onto a wire rack, using the parchment paper as a sling. Let cool before serving. Enjoy!

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To maximize cinnamon roll fluffiness, consider using active sourdough starter instead of discard.</li>
            <li>You may need to knead the dough for much longer than described in the recipe. That's completely okay, so don't worry if you need to knead for 20 minutes! </li>
            <li>The length of the bulk rise will vary depending on your kitchen temperature and whether or not you used active starter or discard. Warmer temperatures typically require less time, while cooler temperatures require more. Using discard will also require more time.</li>

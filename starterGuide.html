            <p>This guide will teach you how to make a beginner-friendly sourdough starter from scratch, step-by-step, day-by-day. All you need is flour, water, and some patience! The process will take roughly 7 days, but depending on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen, it may take 3 days, or up to a few weeks. Remember, every starter and kitchen is different, so stay patient and you'll be rewarded with your very own bubbly sourdough starter!</p>

                <h2>Sourdough Starter From Scratch</h2>
                
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour (bread, all-purpose, or wholegrain)</li>
                    <li>Filtered water</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>Day 1</b><br>
                    In a glass jar or plastic container, mix 1/2 cup of flour and <i>up to</i> 1/2 cup of filtered water (we want the mixture to be thick and mousse-like). Stir vigorously using a spatula, ensuring that all of the flour is fully hydrated. Scrape down the sides and cover with a lid or a paper towel secured with an elastic band. Place an elastic band around the jar/container to mark the baseline of the starter. This will help you monitor your starter's growth, so be sure to adjust the placement of the band after every feeding. Let rest for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 2</b><br>
                    Discard half of the mixture and repeat the process from Day 1: add 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, stir vigorously, and cover. Let rest again for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on.
                </p>

                <p><b>Days 3-7</b><br>
                    You may notice some activity at this point, whether its bubbles, a yeasty smell, or an increase in size. If not, no worries, and keep going! Repeat the steps from Day 2: discard half of the mixture, add 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, stir vigorously, and cover. Let rest again for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on. If at any point you notice that your starter is very bubbly and doubles in size between feedings, you can jump right to baking!
                </p>

                <p>If your starter isn't doubling in size by day 7, keep going with the daily feedings; your starter will become active eventually! If you would like to speed up the process, switch to two daily feedings (12 hours apart) instead of one.</p>

        <!-- buy from store tab-->
        <div class="tabContent" id="buy">
            <p>This guide will teach you how to activate your packet of dehydrated sourdough starter. The starter from my online store is over 150 years old and originates from San Francisco. Since it is a mature, well-established starter, activating it will likely take less time than making your own from scratch, and the result will be stronger as well.</p>

            <div class="instructions">
                <h2>Reactivating Your Sourdough Starter Packet</h2>
                
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour (bread, all-purpose, or wholegrain)</li>
                    <li>Filtered water</li>
                    <li>One package of dehydrated sourdough starter from my online store</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>Day 1</b><br>
                    Mix 1/2 cup of water and your package of dried sourdough starter in a glass jar or plastic container for 2 minutes. Then, add 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons of flour. We want a thick, mousse-like consistency, so feel free to add more flour if necessary. Place an elastic band around the jar/container to mark the baseline of the starter. This will help you monitor your starter's growth, so be sure to adjust the placement of the band after every feeding. Cover the jar/container with a lid or a paper towel secured with an elastic band and let the mixture rest for 24 hours on your kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 2</b><br>
                    Stir the mixture vigorously, and let rest again for 24 hours on your kitchen counter or inside the oven.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 3</b><br>
                    You may notice some activity now, whether it's bubbles, a yeasty smell, or an increase in size. Stir in 1/2 cup of flour and <i>up to</i> 1/2 cup of water. Remember, we want a thick consistency, so only add as much water as you need to achieve this! Cover and rest for 24 hours.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 4</b><br>
                    Repeat the steps from Day 3: add 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, mix, cover, rest.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 5</b><br>
                    At this point you may notice that your starter is very bubbly and doubles in size between feedings. If that's the case, you can skip Days 6-7 and go straight to baking! If not, no worries. Some starters need more time to activate.<br><br>
                    Discard half of the mixture. Add 1 cup of flour, up to 1 cup of water. Cover and let rest for 24 hours. 
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 6</b><br>
                    Repeat the steps from Day 5: discard half of the mixture, stir in 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, cover, and let rest for 24 hours. 
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 7</b><br>
                    At this point your starter is probably active: lots of bubbles, yeasty smell, doubles in size. It's ready to bake! If not, don't worry! Keep repeating the steps every day and your starter will eventually become active. If you would like to speed up the process, switch to two daily feedings (12 hours apart).

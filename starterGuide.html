            <p>This guide will teach you how to make a beginner-friendly sourdough starter from scratch, step-by-step, day-by-day. All you need is flour, water, and some patience! The process will take roughly 7 days, but depending on the temperature and humidity of your kitchen, it may take 3 days, or up to a few weeks. Remember, every starter and kitchen is different, so stay patient and you'll be rewarded with your very own bubbly sourdough starter!</p>

                <h2>Sourdough Starter From Scratch</h2>
                
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flour (bread, all-purpose, or wholegrain)</li>
                    <li>Filtered water</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>Day 1</b><br>
                    In a glass jar or plastic container, mix 1/2 cup of flour and <i>up to</i> 1/2 cup of filtered water (we want the mixture to be thick and mousse-like). Stir vigorously using a spatula, ensuring that all of the flour is fully hydrated. Scrape down the sides and cover with a lid or a paper towel secured with an elastic band. Let rest for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on.
                </p>

                <p><b>Day 2</b><br>
                    Discard half of the mixture and repeat the process from Day 1: add 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, stir vigorously, and cover. Let rest again for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on.
                </p>

                <p><b>Days 3-7</b><br>
                    You may notice some activity at this point, whether its bubbles, a yeasty smell, or an increase in size. If not, no worries, and keep going! Repeat the steps from Day 2: discard half of the mixture, add 1/2 cup flour, up to 1/2 cup water, stir vigorously, and cover. Let rest again for 24 hours on the kitchen counter or inside the oven with the light on. If at any point you notice that your starter is very bubbly and doubles in size between feedings, you can jump right to baking!
                </p>

                <p>If your starter isn't doubling in size by day 7, keep going with the daily feedings; your starter will become active eventually! If you would like to speed up the process, switch to two daily feedings (12 hours apart) instead of one.</p>

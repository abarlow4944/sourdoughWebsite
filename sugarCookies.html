                <h2>Sourdough Discard Sugar Cookies</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Prep time:</b> 2 hours</li>
                    <li><b>Cook time:</b> 11 minutes</li>
                    <li><b>Yield:</b> 20-30 cookies</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>300g all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>500g sourdough discard</li>
                    <li>1 tsp (5g) vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>113g unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
                    <li>150g granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>1. Mix the Wet Ingredients</b><br>
                    Use an electric mixer to cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes). Add the egg and vanilla extract, beat until combined. Pour in the sourdough discard and mix until the ingredients are incorporated.
                </p>

                <p><b>2. Add the Dry Ingredients</b><br>
                    Add the flour and salt to the wet ingredients and use a spatula to mix until just combined. 
                </p>

                <p><b>3. Chill the Dough</b><br>
                    Divide the dough into two pieces, shape each piece into a disk between two pieces of plastic wrap. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until its 1/4" in thickness. Stack the sheets and place in the fridge for a minimum of 2 hours.
                </p>

                <p><b>4. Cut Out Cookies</b><br>
                    Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove a sheet of dough from the fridge, peel off the plastic wrap and use cookie cutters to cut out shapes. Place the cookies onto the baking sheet.
                </p>

                <p><b>6. Bake</b><br>
                    Bake the cookies at 176°C for 11-12 minutes. The edges should be a very light golden brown. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 15 minutes and let cool completely on a cooling rack before decorating.

        <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When cutting out shapes, alternate between the two pieces of cookie dough by cutting out shapes on one sheet while chilling the other in the fridge. The dough will get difficult to cut as they warm up.</li>
            <li>For quick and simple icing, mix 1/2 cup powdered sugar with the tiniest bit of water, no more than a teaspoon. Mix with a spoon and adjust the texture by adding more powdered sugar or water.</li>
        </ul>

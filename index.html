            <h2>Dough You Know Sourdough?</h2>
            <p>What even is sourdough? Sourdough is one of the oldest forms of bread, made using wild yeast and lactic bacteria instead of commercial yeast. This slow-fermentation process creates a unique, tangy flavor and a beautifully chewy texture that bakers and bread lovers adore. Unlike store-bought bread, sourdough uses just three simple ingredients: flour, water, and salt. Yet, the possibilities are endless—from classic loaves to pizza crusts, pancakes, and even desserts!</p>

            <h2>The Proof is in the Dough!</h2>
            <p>There are so many reasons why sourdough baking is so great! Here are a few:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A Lifetime of Bread:</b> With just flour, water, and patience, a single sourdough starter can provide you with years of delicious, hearty bread. It’s a living, breathing companion in your kitchen!<br></li>

                    <li><b>Creative Freedom:</b> Sourdough is more than just bread; it’s a canvas for creativity. Experiment with different flours, flavors, and techniques to make each loaf uniquely yours.<br></li>
    
                    <li><b>Mindful Joy:</b> There’s something incredibly satisfying about slowing down, working with your hands, and seeing the fruits of your labor in a golden, crusty loaf fresh out of the oven.<br></li>
    
                    <li><b>Healthier Bread:</b> Sourdough is easier to digest, packed with natural probiotics, and has a lower glycemic index compared to conventional bread. It also doesn't contain as much gluten and is less likely to spike your blood sugar levels. It’s a treat for your taste buds <i>and </i>your body.</li>
                </ul>

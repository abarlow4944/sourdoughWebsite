## 📖 Project Overview

This personal project, my first website, is a culmination of my passion for sourdough bread and my journey into web development. All the skills used to create this site are completely self-taught, and it's been an exciting process of learning and growing. The website is meant to simplify sourdough baking for beginners, and it covers everything from understanding sourdough starters to exploring creative recipes and building a thriving baking community. 

Through building this site, I've gained hands-on experience in coding, designing, and implementing features like responsive layouts, interactive elements, and APIs. My hope is that this project serves as a foundation for future endeavours, where I can explore more advanced tools and concepts (Bootstrap, React etc) to create even more complex and dynamic websites.

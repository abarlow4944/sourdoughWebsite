            <p>In this step-by-step guide, I'll teach you how to make the most delicious homemade sourdough bread using just three ingredients: flour, water, and salt. This recipe is completely beginner friendly; no need for a bread machine or a stand mixer! It's also 100% vegetarian and vegan! The process is incredibly simple, with only about 10 minutes of actual hands-on work. The hardest part is being patient while you let the wild yeast in your dough do its magic. </p>

                <h2>My Go-To Sourdough Bread Recipe</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Prep time:</b> ~13 hours</li>
                    <li><b>Cook time:</b> 1 hour</li>
                    <li><b>Yield:</b> 1 loaf</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>500g flour (bread or all-purpose)</li>
                    <li>350g filtered water</li>
                    <li>50g active sourdough starter</li>
                    <li>10g salt</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <p><b>1. Make the Dough</b><br>
                    In a large glass bowl, whisk together the water and <i>active</i> sourdough starter. Then, add in the flour and salt and bring the mixture together with your hands until all of the flour is fully hydrated. The dough should be sticky and shaggy. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rest for 1 hour.
                </p>

                <p><b>2. Fermentolyse</b><br>
                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp tea towel and let rest for 1 hour.
                </p>

                <p><b>3. Stretch and Fold</b><br>
                    Pick up the dough on one side, stretch it upwards and fold it over onto itself. Turn the bowl a quarter turn and repeat until you have turned the bowl a full circle. This is one set of stretch and folds.  Cover the bowl and let the dough rest for 30 minutes, and then do another set of stretch and folds. Refer to the video below for a visual tutorial on how to perform stretch and folds.

                <p><b>4. Bulk Fermentation</b><br>
                    Cover the bowl again and let it rest on your kitchen counter for 10-12 hours. The dough should grow significantly in size, with lots of air bubbles visible on the sides of the bowl. The dough should also jiggle if you shake the bowl. 
                </p>

                <p><b>5. Shaping</b><br>
                    Turn the bowl upside down and let the dough naturally fall onto a lightly covered surface. Shape the dough into a ball by gently pulling four sides of the dough into the middle of itself. Turn the dough seam-side down, and use your hands to cup the dough and pull it towards yourself to create a tight ball. Refer to the video below for a visual tutorial on how to shape a round sourdough loaf.

                <p><b>6. Second Rise</b><br>
                    Place a tea towel into the glass bowl from earlier and sprinkle it with rice flour (or regular flour). Place the dough into the bowl seam-side up and let it rest at room temperature for 1-2 hours. 30 minutes before you’re ready to bake, place your dutch oven into your oven and preheat it at 232°C.
                </p>

                <p><b>7. Scoring</b><br>
                    Turn your dough onto a sheet of parchment paper seam-side down and cover the surface of the dough with rice flour (or regular flour). Score the top of the dough using a bread lame, knife, or scissors. Take out your dutch oven and place your dough into it, using the parchment paper as a sling. Place the dutch oven back into your oven.
                </p>

                <p><b>8. Baking</b><br>
                    Bake the sourdough for 20 minutes with the lid on, and then an additional 25-30 minutes with the lid off. Let the bread cool completely on a cooling rack before cutting (roughly 2 hours). Enjoy!
